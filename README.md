Files

The code in R takes into account that the data used to work on for cleaning purpose is present in the same folder
which is un-compressed and their names have also not been altered. Following are the 3 files that will be loaded to the
repository as the course assignment:

1. CodeBook.md  describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

2. run_analysis.R  contains the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps. 

3. tidy.txt is the output of the cleaned text with the average of each variable for each activity
   and each subject.
